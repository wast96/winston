# STYLE.local — book-specific ledger

The living style ledger for THIS book. The composed `STYLE.md` is a build
artifact from the shelf-wide layers; this file is where THIS book's own
decisions accumulate, and it is the only style file a session edits. Sessions
read `STYLE.md` and this file together.

Seeded at the first-chapter voice gate (CLAUDE.md Step 0c) and added to as the
book proceeds. Each rule records the correction, WHY the error happened, and
the fix, so the reasoning travels with the rule. A single correction is a data
point; the rule that prevents the whole class is the deliverable.

Tag every rule:
- `#book` — specific to this title (a character's voice, a term this book
  decides, a quirk of this author). Stays here forever.
- `#promote` — looks general (a whole-language or whole-genre tell). Stays here
  for this book, and is a candidate to lift into a `styles/` layer between
  books, once a second book corroborates it. See `styles/INDEX.md`.

(Obeys CLAUDE.md rule 6: no em dashes in this file's own prose except inside
quoted before/after examples.)

## Voice sharpening (if this book has a nameable authorial voice)

_Two lines fixing the genre layer's generic voice target to THIS author: who
they read like in English, their signature registers. Fill at the voice gate._

## Calibrated rulings (grows through the book)

_Empty until the first-chapter voice gate. Each entry:_

### RULE. <the general rule that prevents the whole class> [#book | #promote]
- **WHY IT HAPPENED.** <the source-language or process cause, so the class is
  recognizable next time>
- **FIX.** <before, then after>
- **CHECK.** <the script or the read that catches a recurrence>

## Decided renderings (this book's word-level ledger)

_One rendering per recurring item, like the glossary but for diction and
function words. Wrong form on the left, decided form on the right. Grows through
the book._

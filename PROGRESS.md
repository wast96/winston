# PROGRESS — The Sword Roars in the West Wind (剑吼西风：中央特科纪事)

The running per-batch log. Written as we go.

## Setup / Survey (this session)

- Source: image-only PDF scan, 350 pages, no text layer. `source.pdf` (73 MB).
  Front cover is an oil painting (kept as the ebook cover, `data/figs/cover.png`,
  extracted byte-identical from PDF p1). Back cover carries the blurb and
  ISBN 978-7-5155-2038-4. Publisher Gold Wall Press (金城出版社), Beijing;
  1st ed. 2021.6 (this scan is the 2022.3 6th printing). 390,000 characters,
  22 print sheets. CIP subject: CCP intelligence / security work, 1927–1935.
- Script/orientation: **simplified Chinese, horizontal** (verified by cover and
  OCR). OCR model: `chi_sim`, `--psm 6`. (chi_sim + chi_sim_vert packs installed.)
- **Page offset: constant 15 across the ENTIRE book (printed = pdf − 15).**
  Verified at every one of the 15 chapter openers plus References and Afterword
  by OCR-reading the folio band of all 335 body pages. No unpaginated plate
  inserts anywhere; no drift. This is an unusually clean scan. The preface runs
  a SEPARATE roman-numeral sequence (pdf 6–10 = i–v); the TOC is pdf 11–15.
- Front matter map: p1 front cover (painting), p2 back cover, p3 title page,
  p4 CIP/copyright, p5 epigraph (He Zhu 六州歌头, source of the title 剑吼西风),
  p6–10 preface (前言 历史不能被妖魔化), p11–15 table of contents.
- Structure: 15 chapters, two levels (chapter + numbered 一/二/… sections),
  86 sections total. Plus authorial Preface (front), and Works Cited (参考文献,
  printed 323) + Afterword (后记, printed 333) as back matter. Full structure,
  every opener's pdf_page/printed_page, in `book.json`. `pdf_end` 350,
  `printed_end` 335.
- Style contract composed: `STYLE.md` (zh + nonfiction layers), `STYLE.local.md`
  seeded. Voice target: first-rate popular narrative history for a general reader.
- Skeleton EPUB built: `out/sword-roars.epub`, full hyperlinked TOC (112 links,
  deep to every section), original cover embedded. `qa_epub.py` PASS;
  **epubcheck 5.1.0 clean (0 errors / 0 warnings)**.
- Figures: NOT yet detected. There may be inline photographs on numbered pages
  (offset is constant, so no separate plate section). Run `find_figures.py`
  per batch and eyeball for line art; the cover is handled.
- Survey delivered to the commissioner; awaiting approval of shape + batching
  before Batch 1 (Chapter One, the voice-gate frozen reference).

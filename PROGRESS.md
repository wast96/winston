# PROGRESS — Zhou Enlai: Commander of the Hidden Front (隐蔽战线统帅周恩来)

The running per-batch log. Write it as you go, not at the end. One section per
batch: what was translated (unit ids, PDF and printed ranges), which checks ran
and what they found, notes added (count and numbering), glossary rows added with
status, figures, and anything flagged for the read-through (uncertain readings,
contradictions with scholarship, choices you were unsure of).

## Setup (survey session, Step 0a/0b)

- **Source:** `source.pdf`, image-only scan, 582 PDF pages, no text layer, no
  bookmarks. 隐蔽战线统帅周恩来 by 穆欣 (Mu Xin), 中国青年出版社 (China Youth
  Press), Beijing, 1st ed. Jan 2002, ISBN 7-5006-4686-0. 377,000 hanzi;
  850×1168 1/32; 17.125 print sheets + 18 plate leaves. Xidian University
  library copy: red oval seal, barcode 11018166, minor handwriting on cover and
  verso (cosmetic; not on body text). CIP subject: 周恩来 生平事迹 1927–1931.
- **Script / orientation:** simplified Chinese, horizontal. OCR model `chi_sim`,
  `--psm 6`. `chi_sim` confirmed installed. Second read: `ocr_dual.py`
  (PaddleOCR not installed; tesseract psm-6/psm-4 + inverted-threshold
  substitute).
- **Page furniture:** running head is the book title centred at the top of body
  pages (verso and recto both show 隐蔽战线统帅周恩来 / the chapter title); folio
  in the bottom outer corner. Crop box NOT yet measured — first engineering task
  of Batch 1 (configure `ocr_crop.py`, validate by OCR that no running-head
  column bleeds into the text box).
- **Structure:** recovered from the printed 目录 (PDF 38–43), verified folio by
  folio against the scan. No numbered chapters: 25 titled chapters + 前言 +
  结束语 + 后记 (28 units, 92 sections). Full structure in `book.json`.
- **Offset:** body is a **constant** `printed = pdf − 43`. Verified at ch01
  (printed 1 = PDF 44), ch25 (printed 509 = PDF 552), 后记 (printed 535 = PDF
  578) and its end (printed 537 = PDF 580). Front matter runs its own
  sequences: 前言 printed 1 = PDF 35 (offset 34); plate folios 1–~32 = PDF
  3–34. `pdf_end` 580, `printed_end` 537.
- **Plates:** PDF 3–34, ~32 numbered plate folios (agent portraits, Zhou/Mao
  handwriting, a captioned 密信). Captions carry names that recur in the text —
  fold these into `figures.json` with real `alt` text as the relevant chapters
  are translated; cross-reference the footnotes.
- **Metadata (Step 0a):** written into `book.json` — title_en "Zhou Enlai:
  Commander of the Hidden Front", author "Mu Xin", publisher China Youth Press,
  series "Winston Translations" #10, subjects set, translator's note drafted.
  Names checked against `authority.json`: Zhou Enlai, Chen Geng, Gu Shunzhang,
  Chiang Kai-shek all agree with the shelf.
- **Skeleton build:** `build_reading_epub.py` → `out/zhou-enlai.epub` (0/28
  translated, full hyperlinked pending-aware TOC + real cover). `qa_epub.py`
  PASS (41 files, all links resolve). epubcheck 5.1.0: 0 errors / 0 warnings.
- **Survey:** `out/SURVEY.md` (characterization + full outline + 18 proposed
  batches at ~30 printed pp). Awaiting commissioner approval (Step 0b gate).

## Open items to resolve in Batch 1

- Measure and configure the OCR crop box; validate by OCR.
- Verify ch01's opener folio and the first section's folio against the scan
  before translating (offset re-check per chapter, though the body offset is
  expected constant).
- Establish the frozen voice reference at the Step 0c gate (first-chapter voice
  approval).

## Batches (proposed; see out/SURVEY.md — awaiting approval)

18 batches, ch00–ch27. B01 = 前言 + ch01. Final batch B18 = ch25 + 结束语 +
后记, kept light for back matter, cover finalisation, and whole-book
reconciliation.
